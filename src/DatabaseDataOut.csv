We know that the Power BI dashboard can be scheduled to refresh systemically. We know that a PDF can be created and attached to an email manually.

We are thinking that since this is a simple manual process involving a few mouse clicks within Power BI, this may be a good use case for RPA. Would you have a few minutes in the coming days to talk through this with us?

The current excel based process is no longer sustainable - we continue to have process errors that require manual intervention 7 days a week starting as early as 530 am.

9200,svc_dam0001,,REC0289,Price Reduction Requests Process,"Walmart.com allows customers to receive a partial refund (adjustment) if an item they purchased subsequently goes down in price. The business case for doing this is to avoid customers returning their item to a Walmart store or Returns Center and re-purchasing at the lower price (with subsequent handling cost of the return)

Customers have been signing up to third party solution providers who monitor their purchases and the online prices of those they shop with. There are two providers we identified as significant volume for Walmart Customer Care, ""Paribus"" and ""Earny""

Customer care receives an average of 7200 template formatted email requests from Earny, and 3800 from Paribus. At 11k per week on average, with a handling time of 3.58 (decimal) minutes, the savings achieved by fully automating the process in a future state equates to 657 hours/week, or 34k hours annualized (over $500k at agent hourly cost rate)

Most of the process is very clearly defined already (no gray area) and we are working to finalize clarity on the way we handle Bulk Buyer definition/logic so as much of the $500k can be successfully realized.

In addition, we are collating the ""standard text"" used for responding to customers who are ""denied"" the requested adjustment.
